corresponding to its measured values in experiments, and the eigenfunctions belonging to different eigenvalues are orthogonal to each other, which is in accord with the physical situation that the two events with different outcomes are mutually exclusive and never happen simultaneously.These statements are easily proved and the proofs are found in any textbook of quantum mechanics, in which, however, we always find another statement accompanied, claiming that the eigenfunctions form a complete set.The statement is physically sound because if we measure a physical quantity in any state, we would and should have a result, the obtained value of which is one of the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator and this implies that any state can be expanded in terms of the eigenfunctions.Even though we would all admit its necessity for a physical ground, the proof of completeness of eigenfunctions would not so easily be done once they constitute a continuous spectrum.This constitutes a striking contrast to the case where only a finite number of discrete states exist, for in such a case one can convince oneself that a finite number of mutually independent vectors are enough to express any state, thus the proof of their completeness is trivial.When a continuous spectrum is involved, only exception where one can easily discuss and confirm the completeness of the eigenfunctions would be the free case.In this case, the plane waves k , i.e., the eigenfunctions of the free Hamiltonian Hpm form a complete orthonormal set in the sense     which are essentially the  Fourier transforms of Diracs delta function, or the resolution of the identity.What is not trivial is to show these relations when the plane wave solutions are replaced with the scattering wave functions for a stationary potential problem.As a matter of fact, even though the asymptotic completeness of the scattering states is proved within the framework of formal scattering theory  and there exists a classic review on the analytical properties of radial wave functions by Newton   , the completeness of, say, the Coulomb scattering wave functions is shown on the basis of Newtons method rather recently   .This is because the longrange potentials were not covered by their treatments and to show it on the basis of Newtons method, one has to evaluate rather involved integrals in the complex k plane.Surprisingly enough, the situation is not at all better for cases with simple potentials, say, the step or well potentials in one dimension.In fact, the proof of the completeness of onedimensional scattering wave functions off a step potential appeared only in the late s    and a mathematically more rigorous treatment for step and well potentials has to be waited until    .Apparently these potentials do not satisfy some of the premises assumed for the general proofs and one has to work out such cases separately even though the potentials are very simple and considered rather elementary.In this paper, we shall demonstrate that the scattering wave functions of a Dirac Hamiltonian for a system with a step potential form a complete orthonormal set, along the same line of thought as   , by summing up all of them.Though the completeness of them in the same system is already shown in    in a mathematically rigorous way, it is still of interest and instructive to see explicitly that the eigenfunctions of an interacting Dirac Hamiltonian can replace the plane waves in  to play the same role.The procedure taken here is intuitive, straightforward, though much involved and in accord with what physicists would expect.The paper is organized as follows.After the introduction of basic ingredients for the free Dirac Hamiltonian in the next section  , the scattering wave functions of the Dirac Hamiltonian for the system with a finite step potential, responsible for an impulsive force at the origin, are presented in section  .They are categorized into several cases depending on the boundary conditions, i.e., if a Dirac fermion with a positive  frequency is incident from the left or the right of the step potential, and on the value of incident energy.The completeness condition expressed in the coordinate space refers to two spatial points and since the potential takes different values at the left and the right of the potential, it is examined for three different cases in section . .The orthogonality between the leftincident and rightincident wave functions is shown explicitly for a particular case as an illustration in section . .The last section  is devoted to a summary and prospect.SECTION Solutions of free Dirac equation.For later convenience, we first fix the notations and normalizations of fourcomponent spinors of the free Dirac Hamiltonian.The stationary plane wave solutions for the free Dirac Hamiltonian   are   for a positive frequency Eppm and   for a negative frequency Ep , where z is the third Pauli matrix,  the    unit matrix and  a twocomponent spinor.Note that since we will consider a step potential, we setup the z axis at right angle with the boundary of the potential and the trivial dependence on the other coordinates x and y is suppressed from the beginning and is ignored completely.The problem is essentially in one spatial dimension, though the spinors live in fourdimensional spacetime and have four components.These spinors are normalized and form a complete orthonormal set     Now, if a constant potential is added to the above Hamiltonian in all space   the corresponding plane wave solutions are Eqqm    for a positive frequency EqVV and   for a negative  frequency EqVV .Notice that the frequency EqV can be positive for small momenta qVm , even though it is to be associated with the spinor v .Note also that the above explicit forms of spinors are not unique since z is commutable with the above H and H and therefore, e.g., zu can be used instead of u .SECTION Scattering states.A scattering problem of a Dirac fermion with mass m off a step potential   where  is the Heaviside step function, is easily solved.m are considered, see figure  .The stationary solutions for the left and rightincident scattering problems, described by the total Hamiltonian   are given by the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian H and are characterized by their boundary conditions, i.e., leftincident  or rightincident , and the  value of their eigenvalue E .SECTION Leftincident cases            E     z , t     .AforEVm EEpEqV and therefore pEm,qm , the leftincident wave function reads as   with the reflection and transmission coefficients   determined by the continuity condition at z  .Here and in the followings, the dependence on the spin s is and will be suppressed in the wave functions.The continuity of the current defined as jzz at z   reads as   which expresses the conservation of the probability  AforVmEVm , no oscillating solution exists for the region z and we have qiim    for EV and   for EV , with the reflection and transmission coefficients   resulting in a total reflection   for the current in the region z vanishes identically.AforVmEm , the solution in the region z is expressed in terms of v EEpEqV or qm    with   The continuity of current implies the conservation of probability   Recall that the ordinary conservation law of probability is satisfied, but a finite and nonvanishing transmission probability survives even at the infinitepotential limit V   This phenomenon is known as the Klein tunneling   .Notice that no leftincident particle is allowed for mEm .AformE , the eigenstates are given by the negativefrequency solutions EEEpEqV    with   The current continuity and the conservation of probability are the same as in .SECTION

as in .BformEm , no oscillating solution exists for the region z and we have piimE    for E and   for E , with   In this case, all particles incident from the right are reflected  BformE , EEpEqVE , and we have    with   In this case, the same current continuity relation and probability conservation as in  follow.SECTION Orthonormality and completeness relation.These eigenfunctions form a complete orthonormal set.First, the orthogonality of the above scattering sates is due to the general argument for selfadjoint Hamiltonians, that is, the eigenfunctions belonging to different eigenvalues are orthogonal to each other.Two  s with different energies are orthogonal and normalized as   where EEp,EEp .s,s representing the orthogonality in spin space is and will be suppressed but understood on the righthand side and where it is necessary.Similarly, we should have   where EVEq,EVEq and   Since the last orthogonality relation is not derived from the above argument for both  and  can happen to belong to the same energy EE , its validity has to be explicitly shown.Incidentally, the fact that the above wave functions in the preceding section are properly normalized can be shown explicitly by calculating the lefthand sides of  and  for each case, however, we may confirm it indirectly when they are shown to satisfy the completeness relation with the right factors.The orthonormality conditions imply that the following form of completeness relation holds   where the unit matrix in spinor space  has been suppressed on the righthand side and we have introduced shorthand notations  and  .SECTION Proof of the completeness relation momentum integrations.As described in Introduction, though it is generally taken for granted that eigenfunctions of a Hamiltonian constitute a complete orthonormal set, which can be shown explicitly when it has only a finite number of discrete eigenstates, to prove it for a Hamiltonian endowed with a continuous spectrum can be another, nontrivial task.In the present case, we need to show that the lefthand side of  is diagonal in both the coordinate and spinor spaces, which would make the proof more involved than the nonrelativistic cases   .Since the step potential takes different values depending on the sign of the coordinate z , we need to consider three cases, that is, z,z , z,z and zz , separately to prove .Casez,zWhen both z and z are negative, i.e., on the left of the potential, the lefthand side of the completeness relation  is explicitly written down as   where it is understood that the summation over spin s has to be taken  and the subscripts p and q are used to distinguish quantities associated with the leftincident  case and the rightincident  case .It is to be noticed that the reflection amplitude for the leftincident case R can be expressed as   for all p by a proper analytical continuation from a large pm EpVm .Similarly the transmission amplitude for the rightincident case T can be understood as a proper analytic continuation of   After the change of variables from q to p VmEqVm , the above expression is simplified as   where EEim and the fact that z is commutable with both spinors u and v has been used.We have to pay due attention to the fact that, even though not explicitly written, the values of q  are different when it appears in association with the spinor u or v , which, of course, applies also to R and T in the above.Observe that there are terms of functions of the difference zz and the sum zz and they are apparently independent of each other.First, all terms that are functions of zz are collected to yield   We note that the transmission probability for the rightincident case pqTq is the same as that for the leftincident case qpTp , which can be explicitly shown by direct calculation, stating that the reciprocal relation in quantum mechanics also holds in this case.Finally, the conservation of probability RpqpTp greatly simplifies the above to reach   where at the first equality the spin sum has explicitly been taken and the unit matrix  is suppressed on the rightmost hand.Second, the remaining terms that are functions of zz are shown to cancel to each other.We understand that the contributions coming from the p integral   can be evaluated on the complex p plane, because the combination zz in the exponents is negative definite, the reflection amplitude decays at least like p for large p , assuring the convergence of the integrands at p and the integrands have no singularities other than the several cuts on the real and imaginary p axis.The integrand proportional to eip can be evaluated on the negative imaginary axis pi , while the other one proportional to eip is to be evaluated on the positive imaginary axis pi , where  in both cases.On the negative imaginary p axis, we set pi and   while on the positive imaginary p axis pi , we have  For small m , E is a real number smaller than m , Epm , and the reflection amplitude associated with spinor u is analytically continued as   because the purely imaginary quantity EpVm has the same phase as that of p on the imaginary axis, for   where pm is a real number and located on the real axis.Similarly, for the reflection amplitude associated with spinor v , we obtain   All contributions coming from small  on the imaginary axis are put together to yield   The coefficient of spinor u vanishes, because   where we have used the relations mE and qm with EE .Similarly, the coefficient of spinor v , since in this case qm with EE , also vanishes  Thus what is remained is the contributions arising from large m , where E becomes purely imaginary.First we note that the function E gains the same phase as that of p on the imaginary axis, i.e., EiimiandxE for m .From the direct calculations, we understand that the reflection amplitude for spinor u is replaced by the following complex numbers on the imaginary axis   while for spinor v ,   Observe that the following equalities hold   The spinor parts for u and v are explicitly worked out, after summing over spin degrees freedom, to be   where the relation andxEm has been used, showing explicitly that they are actually the same.The remaining integrations over  are now written as   which vanishes owing to the above relations  and .This completes the proof of the completeness relation  for z,z .Casez,zAs in the previous case, the lefthand side of  is explicitly written down   where  is defined, when Eqm , as Eqm .Change of variables pq   reduces this to   The reciprocal relation qpTppqTq also holds true in this case, which can be proven by direct calculation, and the probability conservation RqpqTq brings about the delta function  from those terms that depend on the difference zz in the above .The remaining integrations over q are evaluated on the imaginary q axis, where spinors become uu and vv and the reflection amplitude R for spinor u is represented as   and for v ,   and Rq s as the complex conjugates of the corresponding ones.Thus the contributions of terms that are functions of zz are   which can be shown to vanish on the basis of the similar arguments as before.This completes the proof for z,z .CasezzIf the lefthand side of  is explicitly written down in this case, there are eight  different terms existing, corresponding to eight different cases AA and BB .It can be shown, however, that these terms are categorized into four groups, according to their energy eigenvalues,  Em ,  mE ,  Em and  mE . Em  Consider first the contributions arising from those wave functions that are belonging to eigenvalues  greater than Vm .They are expressed as   Observe that in this energy range the reflection and transmission amplitudes are all realvalued and, moreover, the following relations hold   and   Thus the above expression  is simplified to  As a matter of fact, it can be confirmed that the contributions coming from the wave functions belonging to energy eigenvalues greater than or equal to m , Em , are consistently written in this form with the lower limit replaced with p  .When mpVm , in order to make the integrand convergent at p , the first term in  is defined by   while the second term is defined as   Notice that here on the lefthand side, the variable q is to be replaced with that specified at vertical bar i or i in the quantities which are considered as functions of q , while on the righthand side, conjugate operations are to be taken for functions of specified variables.For example, uqiu and uqiu .Since, in the second term of , we analytically continue qi , the term EqmEpVm is replaced with iVEpm in the amplitudes T , which results in the relation TpRpTp .VEVm .The sum of these two terms is just the contribution from the energy range VEVm .In the energy range VmEV , we note that  and   Therefore, the integrand in the parentheses in  becomes nothing but   which is the contribution from this energy range VmEV .Finally in the energy range mEVm , the variable q is a positive number and appears in association with the spinor v as veiqz or veiqz , which implies that the term EVm has to be replaced with iVEm in the amplitude T and with iVEm in Tp in .Note that in either case, q is to be replaced with q .It is straightforward to confirm that the following relations hold, for the leftincident contribution,   and for the rightincident contribution,   The second terms on the righthand sides of these relations  are canceled to each other and finally we arrive at the conclusion that the contributions coming from the energy range Em are consistently written down as   mE  A straightforward calculation yields   where TqRqTq has been used in the first equality.Actually in the first term of the last line, T is evaluated by replacing EpVm by iVEpm in the original one in  and it is confirmed that it coincides with qTq .Under these replacements together with pi , we can show that   q and we get the right exponential factors.A similar argument is applied to the second term.The contribution is now summarized as   where the integration contours are taken along the imaginary p axis.  and  E  We first consider the region  where E   m .The contribution coming from this energy range is   Since in the contribution arising from the region  Em   the relation TqRqTq holds, we can rewrite this as   Furthermore, we confirm that the transmission amplitude in this energy range  is analytically continued for Epm as   so that the contribution coming from region  is expressed as integrations along imaginary p axis  Putting all contributions  together, we understand that the lefthand side of  is conveniently written as   Observe that the exponential factors make the integrands convergent at p in the lowerhalf and upperhalf planes for the first and second lines, respectively, if proper branches have been chosen for momentum q .Since singularities only appear on the real and imaginary axises as branch cuts, the integrals are evaluated on the imaginary p axis, from im to i for the first integral and from i m to i for the second.z and z .We note, however, that the momentum q for spinor u , qm , and that for spinor v , qm , are different quantities, though expressed with the same symbol q for notational simplicity, and we have to choose a proper phase when they are analytically continued.Actually, if we put pi m  and thus EpmiandxE on the imaginary p axis, we have, for spinor u ,   which are different from those for spinor v   We will put together those terms that have the same  dependence.When analytically continued on the imaginary p axis, the first term and the last term in  have the same  dependence eziqz .The first term is evaluated as   while the last term as   Observe that the amplitude Tp is actually the same quantity for both cases, for   After the spin sum, the spinor parts are explicitly written down as   and   We carefully examine the phases of the square roots and understand that these two spinor parts have opposite signs and are canceled to each other.This means that the first term and the last term in  are canceled to give vanishing contribution.A similar argument shows that the remaining two terms, the second and the third terms in , cancel to each other and we can conclude that  vanishes identically.This completes the proof of  for the case of zz , where its righthand side vanishes.To summarize, Cases complete the proof of completeness relation .SECTION Orthogonality between            E       and            E        .As is already stated, only nontrivial relation is the orthogonality relation between  and  .For definiteness, the orthogonality shall be demonstrated here only for the case of E,Em .In this case, the inner product between  and  is explicitly calculated as s,s arising from the spinor inner product shall be suppressed   The second and the last terms contain terms proportional to delta functions   which vanishes because of the relation TpRqqpTqRp .The remaining parts are collected to yield   We note that ppEpEp and qqEqEq and furthermore   Substitution of these expressions into  yields, after a straightforward calculation,   which is zero because EqEpV and EqEpV .Thus the righthand side of  is shown to vanish, which means that the wave function for leftincident case  and that for rightincident case  are orthogonal when E,Em .The above argument would easily be extended to other energy ranges to show the orthogonality between  and  E,E .SECTION Summary and prospect.The scattering states of the Dirac Hamiltonian describing fermions dynamics under the step potential are shown to form a complete set by directly evaluating the momentum integrals.This indirectly justifies that they are properly normalized and they constitute an orthonormal set.Though it has been expected from a physical ground, to show that the scattering states, that is, the eigenstates of a Hamiltonian belonging to continuous eigenvalues form a complete set  is not at all trivial and actually has required careful analysis on their analytic properties, as expounded here in detail.It may be stressed that in this relativistic case, due attention has to be payed also on the spinors, which has made this issue more involved than in the nonrelativistic cases.We observe that irrelevant terms, that do not contribute to the delta function  and thus have to be canceled in the completeness relation, are concisely expressed as ,  or , which would be a reflection of the existence of a more formal treatment in the relativistic case   , like    in the nonrelativistic case.The proof of the asymptotic completeness in    is based on the fact that the scattering states of a particular range of energies  constitute a projection operator on that energy range, which is derived from the construction of the resolvent of the Hamiltonian in terms of the scattering states.The treatment is mathematically rigorous and elegant, however, it might seem a bit technical for physically intuitive eyes.The presentation here, though rather involved and not elegant, would be just what such people is looking for.Actually, just as in    for the nonrelativistic cases, the integrations over momentum have been carried out straightforwardly and explicitly, resulting in the delta function that represents the completeness relation .It would be interesting and instructive to see how such an intuitive approach does work even for this relativistic case.Needless to say, the present issue is closely related to the socalled Klein tunneling    .In this respect, it is worth stressing that the oscillating solution of the Dirac equation in the potential region z when the leftincident energy is below Vm is given by a negative, relative to V , frequency solution Tveiqz , see .This is the right solution that belongs to the correct eigenvalue EEqVVm and satisfies the correct boundary condition, i.e., describing a positive current jzzqmT corresponding to a transmitted wave.The correctness would also be justified by the fact that it is one of the correct elements of the complete set.Other choices would result in the violation of the very eigenvalue problem andor the boundary condition.Therefore as already stated in  , there is no anomaly in the conservation of probability even in this case, but the transmission probability remains nonvanishing in the infinite potential limit V , which is known as the Klein tunneling.The complete orthonormal set obtained in this paper can be used as a basis for further explorations of such a system of fermion under the step potential within the framework of quantum field theory.Work in such a direction is in progress and will be reported elsewhere.
